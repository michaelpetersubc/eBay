From the bid times in the rightmost column of the table, you can see
that evermverm was at one point high bidder, but was displaced by
ernzan.
<p>The bottom row of the the table gives some control information.
The leftmost cell in the column gives the login name of the person who
is next to bid in this auction, <em>doctorv@msc.net</em>. If you click the hyperlink that says
"Add Next Bid Here", the page will refresh and if you scroll back to
this point in the display, you will find that doctorv's bid has been
added to the table. <p>The new bid will be 'blinking'. Normally, I
would agree with you that blinking is very irritating, but in this
case it helps to identify the location of the new bid when there are
many auctions ending at the same time.<p>
For this auction, the last hyperlink, which says "Add Next Overall
Bid", will do exactly the same thing.
If you continue to refresh the page, you will eventually be able to
see all the bids in this auction.  If you want to see what happened in
this auction, it is more efficient to go to <a href="ebay.php">the php
applet</a> and
follow the auction from there.
