The leftmost cell in the column gives the login name of the person who
is next to bid in this auction, _doctorv@msc.net_. If you click the hyperlink that says
"Add Next Bid Here", the page will refresh and if you scroll back to
this point in the display, you will find that doctorv's bid has been
added to the table. 

For this auction, the last hyperlink, which says "Add Next Overall
Bid", will do exactly the same thing.
