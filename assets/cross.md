## Cross Bidding on eBay
The three auctions that end on June 10 are quite rich in behavior. If you click
on the "Add Next Overall Bid" button repeatedly, you will see a bidder
1buckeyes bid first at amcord's auction (far right), then at bensten's
acution (far left) then repeatedly at stefani's auction, then finally
back at amcord's auction.  This bidder is one of the few who followed
the strategy that Severinov and I identified as the 'right' strategy
theoretically.  Mingli Zheng coined the term cross bidding for this
behavior. Unfortunately for 1buckeyes, it didn't work.
