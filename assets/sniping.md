## Sniping
On June 19, 2 auctions ended. The state of the auctions at the
beginning of the day is given below. To see what
happened, keep clicking on the "Add Next overall Bid" until both
auctions are finished.  You will see a bidder called kduran submit a bid in
rodcat's auction that arrives 4 seconds before the auction ends.
This is the only bid kduran submits. This is sniping. This particular attempt
at sniping doesn't actually work for kduran, since he bids a little less than the
eventual winner.
