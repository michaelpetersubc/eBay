## Bidding Against yourself
On June 29, 3 auctions ended. The interesting one is the  middle auction held by musicroom.  
The auction has already finished at the beginning of the day. Jorgemaxit has submitted 4 successive 
winning bids against himself.  This follows 8 successive winning bids by wfeola.  
Perhaps this was designed to scare off other bidders (which it seems to have done).  
I am not sure whether this price joregemaxit pays in this case is $112 or $127.
